## Sprint 6: Analytics, Scaling & Launch
**Goal**: Deliver production-ready platform.  

### Deliverables

- Admin dashboard (platform usage, churn, active users).  
- Reporting exports (CSV/Excel).  
- Monitoring & alerting (Datadog/New Relic).  
- Disaster recovery plan (backups, failover).

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Single agent load** â†’ Avoid scope creep per sprint. Each sprint focuses on *one major epic only*.  
- **Credential verification complexity** â†’ Start simple (manual upload + admin validation) before API automation.  
- **Payment compliance** â†’ Stripe sandbox integration first, production onboarding later.  

---

## Success Metrics
- 70% of shifts filled within 24h by MVP launch.  
- 60% of nurses returning weekly.  
- <2 second response time for shift search.
