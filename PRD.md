# PRD: Nursing Shift Matching & Discovery Platform

## 1. Overview
The application is a **two-sided marketplace** connecting hospitals and medical facilities with qualified, available nurses. Hospitals can fill gaps in their staffing needs by posting open shifts, while nurses can discover, claim, and schedule additional shifts based on their training, certifications, and proximity.

The platform reduces staffing shortages, increases workforce flexibility, and provides nurses with more control over their schedules.
